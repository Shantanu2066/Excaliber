Hey claude. I want to build a web based canvas application, using either react js or next js as the frontend. Let me describe you the features of the canvas application- 

1.	It should have freehand sketching feature. So that if someone is using pencil on tablets or pen tab in pc, they can sketch or basically handwrite anything freely
2.	for handwriting based applications, latency is a very critical factor to handle. make sure to handle the latency and keep it as minimal as possible
3.	there should be a sidebar on top of the screen where we can select the pen, pen size under it (for sketching). the sidebar should have some standard shapes like straight line, circle, rectangle etc
4.	there should be a textbox support, which when we click on, the text box appears. no need to focus on fonts but we can increase or decrease size or change text colour. we can increase or decrease textbox size if we want
5.	the canvas should be unlimited like it happens for most cases, like excalidraw also. we should be able to click and move the canvas as we want. default zoom is set at 100%

basically I am wanting to create a canvas similar to excalidraw but with handwriting / free sketching support. is it possible for you to build it ? if yes use next js or react js as frontend. I am not sure if this requires backend, but if it does you can use nodejs. 

Also do not forget to update the readme file. Let's Go !
